## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/UNet-Segmentation.git
cd UNet-Segmentation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python and all required libraries installed. You can install dependencies using `requirements.txt` (if available) or the following libraries manually:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

### 3. Dataset Preparation 📦

1. Download a dataset (e.g., medical images for segmentation) or use any dataset relevant to your task.
2. Place your images inside the `data/` folder.
3. Update the paths in the notebook to load your dataset.

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook 📓

To train the model or test it with your dataset, open the `UNET.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook UNET.ipynb
```

### 5. Train the Model 🏋️‍♂️

Run the notebook cells to train the UNet model. You can customize parameters like input size, batch size, and epochs in the notebook.

### 6. Evaluate the Model 🔍

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU (Intersection over Union). Visualize the segmented output by comparing predictions with ground truth images.

## 🧠 Understanding UNet

The UNet architecture consists of two parts:
- **Encoder (contracting path)**: Captures context by progressively downsampling the input image.
- **Decoder (expanding path)**: Reconstructs the full-resolution image by upsampling.

It is widely used in medical imaging for tasks such as:
- Tumor detection
- Organ segmentation
- Lesion identification

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

```
Input -> [Conv -> Conv -> MaxPool] * n -> [Bottleneck Layer] -> [Upsample -> Conv -> Conv] * n -> Output
```

- Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling Layers
- Upsampling Layers
- Skip Connections between encoder and decoder

## 🧩 Customization

You can customize the UNet model by modifying the following parameters in the notebook:
- **Input size**: Adjust the size of input images.
- **Number of filters**: Vary the number of filters in each convolutional layer.
- **Depth**: Control how deep the network is (i.e., how many downsampling steps).

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Dice Coefficient**
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**
- **Pixel-wise accuracy**
